# libcurl kotlin-native - standalone version
kotlin native libcurl

Libcurl static 64bit library, with zlib and SSL support, compiled with mingw64.

Can be used within Kotlin-native projects to produce standalone executables with curl, openssl and zlib support.

Also there are implementations of an Kotlin adaptative buffer and in(out)putstream for file read and write support.

Started a ObjectInput/OutputStream too, based on JVM function, still in draft
